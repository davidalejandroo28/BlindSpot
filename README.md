# Blind Spot: Smart Assistive Cane for the Visually Impaired

**Blind Spot** is a cost-effective, Arduino-based smart walking cane designed to assist visually impaired individuals in detecting nearby obstacles. Developed by a multidisciplinary team, the project incorporates human-centered design, energy efficiency, and 3D-printed components for accessibility and comfort.

## 🚀 Features

- Ultrasonic obstacle detection using Arduino Uno
- Haptic feedback when objects are within a set distance
- Red LED indicator for nighttime visibility
- 3D-printed housing for secure mounting and component protection
- Lightweight and energy-efficient design powered by a 9V battery

## 👥 Team

- David Dorante (Project Manager)  
- Santiago Alvarez (Software Engineer)  
- Aaron Norris (Industrial Designer)  
- Yumandy Espinosa (Supplier)  
- Lucas Aguirre (Head of R&D)  

## 📦 Components

- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04)
- Red LED
- Buzzer or vibration motor
- 9V battery
- 3D-printed enclosure (Tinkercad)
- Zip ties for mounting

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Arduino IDE (C/C++ firmware)
- Tinkercad (3D modeling and circuit simulation)
- Google Drive (video tutorial and documentation)
- Conceptboard (collaborative design planning)

## 📋 User Instructions

1. Hold the cane at the top soft surface where bumps are felt for grip.
2. Start walking. The buzzer/LED will activate if an obstacle is detected within a pre-set range.

## 🔧 Limitations & Future Improvements

- **Limited Field of View**: Only detects objects directly in front.
- **Manual Firmware Changes**: Distance threshold adjustment requires editing code.
- **Exposed Circuitry**: Needs a protective casing for dust and water resistance.
- **Battery Access**: Tied with zip ties; future versions could use a battery housing.

## 🌱 Ethical & Environmental Considerations

- Uses a single 9V battery to reduce waste
- Designed for affordability (~$50-$70) and ease of replacement
- Prioritized safety and accessibility for the blind community
